The mod is simple. Every time a player kills a zombie, a code is executed that selects a random number. If the number matches one of the winning prizes, the prize is left in the zombie's body for the player to retrieve.

Currently, the option mode has been added as a dependency to allow for some client-side options, such as displaying a message when a die rolls that isn't the winner, or enabling chat messages.

With the recent changes, the idea is to continue adding more options and personalizing the experience as much as possible.
