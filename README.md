# Items Awards

The mod is intended to reward players for eliminating a certain number of zombies. Currently it works for single player, I have to review the use in multiplayer and it does not have too much complexity. Within the table, you can set the prizes to be awarded, and the amount of zombies required to get the prize.

I will try to make changes and updates, adding support for multiplayer, as well as all available languages. I hope you find this mod useful, and if so, I invite you to give it a good rating.
